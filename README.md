# Array Sort Project

This Java project demonstrates the sorting of arrays using the Bubble Sort algorithm. It includes methods for generating random arrays, sorting the array, and displaying the result.

## Project Structure

- **Display**: Main class that runs the program. Generate an integer array, fill it with random numbers, sort the array using Bubble Sort, and display the results.
- **MethodBubbleSort**: Contains an implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm and an auxiliary method for exchanging elements.
- **MethodRadom**: Provides methods for generating random numbers and populating the array with these numbers.

## Features

- **Generate Random Array**: The `populateArray` method fills an array with random numbers between 1 and 20.
- **Sort Array**: The `bubbleSort` method uses the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the array.
- **Display Results**: The array is displayed before and after sorting.
